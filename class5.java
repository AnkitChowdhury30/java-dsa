/*
 In Java, a static block (also known as a static initializer) is a block of code that is executed only once when the class is loaded into memory by the Java ClassLoader. This block is primarily used for initializing static variables or performing setup operations that are needed before the class is used.

Key Features of Static Block:
Executed Once: The static block runs only once, when the class is loaded.
Runs Before the Main Method: If the class contains a main() method, the static block will execute before main().
No Explicit Call Required: The Java runtime automatically executes the static block; you donâ€™t need to call it.
Multiple Static Blocks: A class can have multiple static blocks, and they are executed in the order they appear in the code.
